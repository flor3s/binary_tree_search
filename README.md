# Binary Trees

## This project builds
* a simple binary tree data structure from arbitrary input
* a function that locates data inside of the tree
* numerous search methods: `#breadth_first_search`, `#depth_first_search`, `#depth_first_recursive`

Tests of methods can be found at https://repl.it/@daveyjones/binary-tree
